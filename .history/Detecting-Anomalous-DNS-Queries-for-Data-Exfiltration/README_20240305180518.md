#DNS Exfiltration Detection Script
This script is designed to identify potential data exfiltration attempts through DNS queries by analyzing patterns that deviate from normal network behavior. It flags DNS queries based on several indicators, such as high frequency of queries to rare domains, unusually long query strings, and a significant volume of queries over a short period.
