#DNS Exfiltration Detection Script
This script is designed to identify potential data exfiltration attempts through DNS queries by analyzing patterns that deviate from normal network behavior. It flags DNS queries based on several indicators, such as high frequency of queries to rare domains, unusually long query strings, and a significant volume of queries over a short period.

##Features
- Frequency Analysis: Detects domains queried at unusually high frequencies, which could indicate automated query generation for data exfiltration.
- Domain Rarity: Identifies rare domains that receive a high volume of queries, suggesting a potential channel for data exfiltration.
- Query Length Analysis: Flags unusually long DNS queries, which may be used to encode and transmit data outside the network.
