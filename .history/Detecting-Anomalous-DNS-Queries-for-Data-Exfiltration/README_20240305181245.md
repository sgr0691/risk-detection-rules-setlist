#DNS Exfiltration Detection Script
This script is designed to identify potential data exfiltration attempts through DNS queries by analyzing patterns that deviate from normal network behavior. It flags DNS queries based on several indicators, such as high frequency of queries to rare domains, unusually long query strings, and a significant volume of queries over a short period.

##Features
- Frequency Analysis: Detects domains queried at unusually high frequencies, which could indicate automated query generation for data exfiltration.
- Domain Rarity: Identifies rare domains that receive a high volume of queries, suggesting a potential channel for data exfiltration.
- Query Length Analysis: Flags unusually long DNS queries, which may be used to encode and transmit data outside the network.

##Dependencies
This script is written in Python and requires Python 3.6 or later. The only external dependency is the "collections" and "re" libraries for handling data structures and regular expressions, which are included in the standard Python library and do not require separate installation.

##Installation
No installation is necessary beyond ensuring that Python 3.6+ is available on your system. You can download Python from python.org and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

##Usage
1. Prepare your DNS log data in the format expected by the script. Logs should be a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a DNS query log containing at least domain and query keys.
2. Import the detect_dns_exfiltration function from the script into your Python environment.
3. Call the function with your DNS log data and optional parameters for thresholds:
