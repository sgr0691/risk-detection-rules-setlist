Failed Login Attempt Detector
This Python project includes scripts to detect multiple failed login attempts, which is a common indicator of brute-force attacks. It provides a basic framework for analyzing login attempt logs to flag suspicious activities based on IP addresses, usernames, and temporal patterns.

Features
Basic Detection: Identifies multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
Sliding Time Window Detection: Detects multiple failed attempts within a specified time window, offering dynamic analysis to catch persistent attackers.
User and IP Aggregation: Aggregates failed attempts by both user and IP address, pinpointing targeted attacks.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Installation
No additional installation is required beyond ensuring Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

Usage
Each script can be run independently based on the specific detection strategy you wish to employ. Below are examples of how to use each script:
