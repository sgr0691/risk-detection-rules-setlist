# Failed Login Attempt Detector
This Python project includes scripts to detect multiple failed login attempts, which is a common indicator of brute-force attacks. It provides a basic framework for analyzing login attempt logs to flag suspicious activities based on IP addresses, usernames, and temporal patterns.

## Features
Basic Detection: Identifies multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
Sliding Time Window Detection: Detects multiple failed attempts within a specified time window, offering dynamic analysis to catch persistent attackers.
User and IP Aggregation: Aggregates failed attempts by both user and IP address, pinpointing targeted attacks.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
### Installation
No additional installation is required beyond ensuring Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

### Usage
Each script can be run independently based on the specific detection strategy you wish to employ. Below are examples of how to use each script:

### Basic Detection
```python
from detect_failed_logins import detect_failed_logins

# Example log data
logs = [
    # Include log entries here...
]

# Detect multiple failed login attempts
flagged_attempts = detect_failed_logins(logs)
print("Flagged IPs for multiple failed login attempts:", flagged_attempts)
```
### Sliding Time Window Detection
```python
from detect_failed_logins_sliding_window import detect_failed_logins_sliding_window

# Example log data
logs = [
    # Include log entries here...
]

# Detect attempts within a sliding window
flagged_attempts = detect_failed_logins_sliding_window(logs)
print("Flagged IPs within sliding window:", flagged_attempts)

```
